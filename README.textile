This is a collection of libraries for the "Arduino":http://pololu.com/catalog/product/2191 that interfaces with the Pololu "Zumo Shield":http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/2504 and "Zumo robot kit":http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/2505. These libraries provide functions to help you program an Arduino-controlled Zumo robot.

h2. Getting Started

h3. Software

Download the archive from "GitHub":https://github.com/pololu/zumo-shield-arduino, decompress it, and move each library folder (Pushbutton, ZumoBuzzer, and ZumoMotors) into the "libraries" subdirectory inside your Arduino sketchbook directory. You can view your sketchbook location by selecting File->Preferences in the Arduino environment; if there is not already a "libraries" folder in that location, you should create it yourself. After installing the library, restart the Arduino environment so it can find the Zumo Shield libraries and their examples.

h3. Hardware

The Zumo Shield for Arduino can be purchased on Pololu's website "by itself":http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/2504 or as part of a "Zumo robot kit for Arduino":http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/2505. See the "Zumo Shield user's guide":http://www.pololu.com/docs/0J57 for more details.
